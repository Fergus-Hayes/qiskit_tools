    "# Linear piecewise function\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look into how to evaluate a function using a linear piecewise approximation. This operation is based on the more general [piecewise polynomial function approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12445). In this notebook we will have an overlook of what this requires, then we will build the operation using the elements we introduced in previous notebooks. \n",

    "## An overview\n",

    "We look to approximate the function $f(x)$ given $x$ with a linear function within $2^m$ domains such that $f(x)\\approx A_1^lx + A_0^l$ for $x$ within domain $l$.\n",
    "This operation takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |x\\rangle^{\\otimes n}_x|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n_a}_o \\rightarrow |x\\rangle^{\\otimes n}_x|A_1^l x + A_0^l \\rangle^{\\otimes n_a}_o $$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have excluded any ancillary registers. Here we will look into how this can be done. Let us break this operation down into several steps:\n",
